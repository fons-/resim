**Description**
When moving near the speed of light, the perception of the world around the observer is drastically different due to relativistic effects. To visualise these effects, we developed a relativistic 3D game engine in which the speed of light can be artificially decreased, allowing the player to explore a relativistic world in a visual and interactive manner. After conducting a theoretical survey, the program was created using the C# programming language and OpenGL. The program is open source, cross-platform and designed to be intuitive, to support a wide range of users.

**Building ReSim**
ReSim requires the OpenTK 1.1 library, available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/opentk/files/opentk/opentk-1.1/stable-5/

You can see relativistic effects when moving around (speed of light is 10 m/s in this example):

Software events are also relativistic:
